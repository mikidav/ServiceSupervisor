ServiceSupervisor ‚Äì System Overview
The DroneServiceSupervisor is a lightweight service management system designed to monitor, control, and ensure the health and resilience of various drone-related services operating in a closed, resource-constrained Windows environment.

üîç Purpose
The system supervises multiple microservices responsible for drone telemetry, mission planning, communication, video processing, and more. It ensures:

Real-time health monitoring via heartbeat signals (UDP or HTTP)

Automatic service recovery in case of failure

Decoupled communication between the core service and the user interface

üß© Components
Supervisor Service (REST API) ‚Äì A Windows background service (or console) that monitors drone services and exposes a REST interface for status and control.

Supervisor UI (WPF) ‚Äì A lightweight graphical interface that interacts with the supervisor via HTTP to display live statuses and allow manual restarts.

Drone Services ‚Äì Individual modules (e.g., telemetry, mission planner, gateway, video) each sending periodic health signals.

Configuration ‚Äì JSON-based configuration for service paths, ports, health protocols, and restart policies.

üì° Health Monitoring
Each drone-related service sends a heartbeat message every 500ms using one of two protocols:

UDP ‚Äì For minimal-overhead local signaling (health:TelemetryService:Healthy)

HTTP ‚Äì ASP.NET services expose /healthz endpoints compliant with HealthCheck standards

üõ°Ô∏è Resilience Features (via Polly or equivalent logic)
Retry logic

Timeout limits

Circuit breaker pattern

Fallback behaviors

Startup delays and dependency ordering

üí° Design Considerations
Fully offline environment

Minimal resource usage (CPU, RAM)

No external cloud services

Extensible architecture supporting future UI plugins
